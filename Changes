TODO: optimise common cases of my $self = shift; my ($a,$b,$c) = @_; at function start

	- optimised all PUSHMARKs into a single stack extend per function,
          which hopefully is guarenteed to work.
        - removed $Config{LIBS} from linker call: doesn't seem to be needed, and
          contains a lot of garbage libs on debian.
        - port to 5.10.0's xsub changes.
